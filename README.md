## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Work! (layout, basic pen tool)
- Week 3: Work! (technicalities, troubleshooting, color selection and brush size)
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

By far, the hardest hurdle to overcome was the color selection. Not only could I somehow not figure out how to calculate the region you would have to click in order to change the brush color. I modified an existing code (linked below) to figure this out, after a lot of trial and error and going to sleep angry.

## References and links

I referenced [this](https://editor.p5js.org/projects/HJdsXS1BZ) code to figure out how I should format my color selection, which I had to modify since my color wells were positioned differently.

I also referenced the old layout for MS Paint, which I hold a lot of nostalgia for. The very specific beige of the interface and the blue headbar of an old Windows computer is locked in my memory permanently.
