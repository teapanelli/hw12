# Paint the Town

A MS Paint-inspired drawing program made in p5.

## Summary

I grew up drawing on MS Paint as a kid, and I wanted to do something simple and artistic for my final project. It won't be flashy orexcessive, just barebones and simple to call back to its reference material.

Interactivity includes keyboard and mouse input.

## Component Parts

The Project is just a p5 project, so there is nothing particularly outstanding about the code I'm using. (EDIT: I reference an existing p5 code, which I link below.)

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Work! (layout, basic pen tool)
- Week 3: Work! (technicalities, troubleshooting, color selection and brush size)
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

By far, the hardest hurdle to overcome was the color selection. Not only could I somehow not figure out how to calculate the region you would have to click in order to change the brush color. I modified an existing code (linked below) to figure this out, after a lot of trial and error and going to sleep angry.

## References and links

I referenced [this](https://editor.p5js.org/projects/HJdsXS1BZ) code to figure out how I should format my color selection, which I had to modify since my color wells were positioned differently.

I also referenced the old layout for MS Paint, which I hold a lot of nostalgia for. The very specific beige of the interface and the blue headbar of an old Windows computer is locked in my memory permanently.
